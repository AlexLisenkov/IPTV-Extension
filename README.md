# Ice-Poseidon-TV
The (un)official Ice Poseidon Chrome extension, includes features like showing a notification when Ice goes live.

## Update logs
**V1.2:** Sound effect option added per /u/Takamiya's request, custom sounds coming soon!  
**V1.3:** Made own live API to avoid the extension being rate limited.

## TODO
- Change icon to green when Ice goes live
- Show most recent tweet
- Small link to github and options page in popup
- Twitch emotes (Working on this right now)
- Changing name color in chat (will require websocket communication between clients)
